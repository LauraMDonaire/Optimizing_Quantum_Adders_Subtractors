# Optimizing_Quantum_Adders_Subtractors
This repository focuses on optimizing quantum adder and subtractor circuits to reduce computational costs, specifically by minimizing T-gate, and CNOT gate usage in the BCD-Adder. It explores designs with the Clifford+T gate set, proposing improved versions for greater efficiency and fault tolerance in quantum computing.
